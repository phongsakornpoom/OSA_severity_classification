My master's project focused on developing a deep learning model to classify Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) severity using cephalometric radiographs and clinical data.
OSA is a sleep disorder with potentially severe long-term consequences.
This project aimed to address the challenges associated with traditional diagnostic methods.

Total of 3 models were constructed with Pytorch.
1. Pure CNN ultilizing only lateral cephalometric radiograph
2. VGG19 model ultilizing only lateral cephalometric radiograph with Imagenet weight
3. Combined model ultilizing both lateral cephalometric radiograph and clinical information with VGG19

All the data were from Ramathibodi Hospital under Mahidol University for Pongsakorn Tanupatrasakul training under 'Data science for Healthcare and Clinical informatics' Master program 2021-2024
